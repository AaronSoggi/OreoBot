It will also be helpful to try and challenge this type of thinking by focusing ways in which you are worthwhile as a person and have worth in your life. CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) may be particularly helpful with this too. If you are open to seeing a therapist, find one that does CBT. You can also find resources on CBT online.
