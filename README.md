## **Introduction**


Oreobot OreoBot is a Web application which was created using Visual studio code. This was a university project which is to help students cope with any problems at university that are related to anxiety and the most common symptoms of depression. After performing research, I have targeted the most common issues that students face throughout higher education, and have put together my own conversational intents that will be used to communicate with the student. 

I have integrated the chatbot onto my own website which includes a login and registration page. To ensure that the student is given as much support as possible, I have included two sections on the website, which defines the intentions of the chatbot so users are aware of its objectives and the audience its targeting. Secondly a student advice section is available which gives information about who they can contact if they find themselves suffering from any major mental health conditions. 



## **Screenshots**

Below are some screenshots of the application, which gives a better perspective of the user interface.

My intention here was to not overload the website with too many irrelevant features as this would intimidate the user and convince them that the application is complex. By keeping the layout simple with space between all elements it helps bring them to life and more evident to the human eye.
